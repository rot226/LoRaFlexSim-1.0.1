# LoRa Network Simulator 4.0

This repository contains a lightweight LoRa network simulator implemented in Python. The latest code resides in the `VERSION_4` directory and is based on a simplified version of the FLoRa model so it can run without OMNeT++. This approach omits the detailed OMNeT++ physical layer, which may reduce accuracy compared to full-stack simulators.

## Features
- Duty cycle enforcement to mimic real LoRa constraints
- Optional node mobility with Bezier interpolation
- Multi-channel radio support
- Advanced channel model with loss and noise parameters
- Optional multipath fading and external interference modeling
- Antenna gains and cable losses for accurate link budgets
- Optional LoRa spreading gain applied to SNR
- Additional COST231 path loss, Okumuraâ€‘Hata model and 3D propagation via `AdvancedChannel`
- Terrain and weather based attenuation parameters
- Configurable bandwidth and coding rate per channel
- Preset propagation environments (urban/suburban/rural) for quick channel setup
- Capture effect and a minimum interference time to ignore very short overlaps
- Initial spreading factor and power selection
- Full LoRaWAN ADR layer following the official specification (LinkADRReq/Ans,
  ADRACKReq, channel mask, NbTrans, ADR_ACK_DELAY fallback) and derived from the
  FLoRa model
- Optional battery model to track remaining energy per node
  (FLoRa energy profile)
- Regional channel plans for EU868, US915, AU915 and Asian bands
- Customizable energy profiles with a simple registry

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd VERSION_4
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the dashboard
panel serve launcher/dashboard.py --show

# From the repository root use
panel serve VERSION_4/launcher/dashboard.py --show
```

The dashboard now exposes a **Seed** input. Set the same value on
subsequent runs to keep the node placement identical.
Enable **Manual positions** to override node or gateway coordinates. Each line
should follow `node,id=3,x=120,y=40` or `gw,id=1,x=10,y=80`.

# Run a simulation
```bash
python run.py --nodes 20 --steps 100
```

Add `--seed <n>` to obtain the same node placement on each run.
Use `--runs <n>` to repeat the simulation several times and average the metrics.

You can also execute the simulator directly from the repository root:

```bash
python VERSION_4/run.py --nodes 20 --steps 100
```

For a detailed description of all options, see `VERSION_4/README.md`.

## Advanced usage

Here are some commands to explore more simulator features:

```bash
# Multi-channel simulation with node mobility
python VERSION_4/run.py --nodes 50 --gateways 2 --channels 3 \
  --mobility --steps 500 --output advanced.csv

# LoRaWAN demo with downlinks
python VERSION_4/run.py --lorawan-demo --steps 100 --output lorawan.csv
```

### FLoRa INI scenario example

To reproduce a typical FLoRa configuration and check the SF distribution per
node, run the helper script below. It applies the "Mode FLoRa complet" settings
with ADR variant 1 and fixed node positions:

```bash
python examples/run_flora_example.py --runs 5 --seed 123
```

The script prints the Packet Delivery Ratio and spreading factor histogram for
each run.
Pass the `--flora-csv <file>` option to automatically compare these metrics with
an official FLoRa CSV export using `compare_with_sim`.

You can now load similar scenarios directly from an INI file using
``Simulator(config_file="file.ini")``. The file must define ``[gateways]`` and
``[nodes]`` sections listing the coordinates (and optionally SF and power) of
each entity.

Use a preset propagation environment from Python:

```python
from VERSION_4.launcher.channel import Channel
suburban = Channel(environment="suburban")
```

You can analyze the resulting CSV file with:

```bash
python examples/analyse_resultats.py advanced.csv
```

If you collected several runs into one CSV via the dashboard or
`python VERSION_4/run.py --runs <n> --output results.csv`, use
`analyse_runs.py` to compute the average metrics for each run:

```bash
python examples/analyse_runs.py results.csv
```

## Cleaning results

Remove duplicated rows and `NaN` values from a CSV file using
`clean_results.py`. The cleaned file is saved as `<file>_clean.csv`:

```bash
python VERSION_4/launcher/clean_results.py results.csv
```

## Validating results

Run the test suite to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
pytest -q
```

The tests compare RSSI and airtime calculations against theoretical values and check collision handling.

### Cross-check with FLoRa

The module `VERSION_4/launcher/compare_flora.py` reads CSV exports from
the FLoRa simulator and extracts the Packet Delivery Ratio and the
spreading factor histogram. The test file
`tests/test_flora_comparison.py` demonstrates how to compare these
values with those returned by `Simulator.get_metrics` to validate the
Python implementation against OMNeT++ runs.
You can also supply a reference CSV to `examples/run_flora_example.py` via
`--flora-csv` to perform this check outside the test suite.
